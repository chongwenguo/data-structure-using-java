Royal C. Nemiah developed a love of Germany during study at Gottingen, cut off by impending war. So cherished was his view of German life before World War I that he publicly denounced Hitler in numerous speeches long before America entered World War II. At Dartmouth he taught a full range of classics courses and German for 40 years, wrote encyclopedia entries on classical authors and subjects, and edited a collection of the historians that enjoyed popularity in classical literature and civilization courses. He believed strongly in the ethical value of teaching and said, “The ultimate end of the teacher is to enable men to arm themselves to make decisions with courage and to face life with nobility.”

Neugebauer’s interests at the Akademisches Gymnasium, Graz, in mathematics, mechanics, and technical drawing foreshadowed his later work, but his interest in the required Greek and Latin was nil, so that when in 1917 His Imperial Majesty’s Army offered enlistment to final-year students with consequent exemption from part of their final exams, he promptly accepted. After a year as a POW in Italy he entered the University of Graz to study electrical engineering and physics; upon transfer to Munich he attended lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld and Arthur Rosenthal. After a further move to Göttingen, his major professors became R. Courant, E. Landau, and E. Noether, all mathematicians. Here he learned Egyptian in order to study and eventually write his dissertation on Egyptian mathematics. In 1933 he was forced by the Nazis to leave Gottingen and found a haven in Copenhagen, whence he moved to Brown in his

            </p>
            <p>
year when conditions for work in Denmark proved impossible. Once in the United States he began writing solely in English, which he preferred, since, as he once said, it improved his style and interpretations—there are no dense musings on theory or method in his English-language works.
            </p>
            <p>
Mathematics is both an independent universal and in its individual development embedded in its culture. Neugebauer’s work from his dissertation to his death was always responsive to this duality. His work on the history of ancient mathematics and astronomy was extremely wide–ranging and influential (not always to the joy of those who believe all ancient wisdom culminates in Greek philosophy); he contributed as well to the bibliography of modern mathematics, founding and editing two international review journals, 
            </p>
            <p>
Zentralblatt fur Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete 
            </p>
            <p>
and later 
            </p>
            <p>
Mathematical Reviews. 
            </p>
            <p>
For ancient mathematics he founded and edited the journal

            <p>
Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Astronomie und Physik, 
            </p>
            <p>
as well as discovering and writing the history of Babylonian mathematics and astronomy, for which he learned Akkadian. Within classics he always emphasized the connections to other Near Eastern cultures’ mathematics and astronomy. He discussed the concepts of roots and of zero known to the Babylonians, and showed that zero was known to Greek mathematicians

            <p>
(Exact Sciences, 
            </p>
            <p>
pp. 11–4, 26, pi. 2); he analyzed the earliest extant determination of longitude by Heron, which also produced one of the three known dates for Heron; and wrote often about fundamental methods and problems in the field. In 1938 he destroyed E. Meyer’s “erstes sicheres Datum der Weltgeschichte,” as it was based on a misunderstanding of the Egyptian “Sothic” period.
            </p>
            <p>
He always held that skilled scientific and philological publication and analysis of sources (preferably new) were vastly to be preferred to superficial synthesis. Hence his papers on astronomical fragments in Plutarch and Galen and on many papyri. The last of these, which was his last publication, turned out to be a table of lunar positions known from third- to second-century 
            </p>

            <p>
cuneiform, but here in Greek from second- to third-century A.D.—thus proving the extensive transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greeks and its use well after Ptolemy. With W. Kendrick Pritchett he published a very influential book on the Athenian calendars and several articles on ancient scientific instruments. He rightly insisted on the value and importance of astrological texts for establishing astronomical theory and ancient chronology and published the definitive collection of ancient Greek and Roman horoscopes, as well as numerous smaller pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
His work on Greek astronomy, though not at the center of his interests (only about one quarter to one third of his over 300 publications), remains fundamental and often iconoclastic. From his early work on Apollonios and Heron and his provocative article on the conic sections to his demonstration that the Babylonians never discovered the precession of the equinoxes, contrary to the claims of some modern scholars, one can always see his insistence on a close and informed reading of the texts. His book

            <p>
The Exact Sciences in Antiquity 
            </p>
            <p>
is of permanent value and instructs on every reading (I have used it for a course on the history of ancient science). His analyses even of “standard” texts were always insightful and visual, accompanied by clear diagrams drawn by himself. Among his important contributions are his explanation of the geometrical origin of Eudoxos’ “hippopede,” his analysis of Apollonios’ planetary theory (the “eccentric”), on Hipparchus as observer and collector of Babylonian observations, his studies of the geometry of Ptolemy’s map–projection and of the astronomy of Hypsikles (ca. 150

B.C.), 
            </p>
            <p>
and his proof that Heraclides Ponticus had no heliocentric theory. These studies culminated in his

which covers Ptolemy and his major antecedents Apollonios and Hipparchus, then Babylonian astronomy, earlier Greek astronomy, and finally Roman and late antique astronomy (short work indeed is made of the trivial Egyptian astronomy; several Greek works, notably Geminus and Cleomedes, are redated). His reviews are often more valuable than the books reviewed, and always of great use—here I note especially the reviews of Mugler in which Neugebauer points out Mugler’s unwarranted restriction to a small subset of the available sources; of Stahl, whose work is an example of the superficial handbook tradition he studies; and of the latest and wretched-English translation of the earliest complete Greek mathematical text, Autolycus.
            </p>
            <p>
Not only did he publish widely and often, he produced a corps of notable students and younger colleagues: A. Aaboe, A. Jones, D. Pingree, and G. J. Toomer (in alphabetical order) will be known to classicists (there are many others). Neugebauer had both a broad and deep view and his work as editor, teacher, and scholar profoundly altered our view of antiquity.

Neville’s life was one of service to his university, his church, and his country. In his 39 years at U.W.O. as professor, dean, and registrar, he shaped some and influenced all of the policies which transformed Western from a college without its own buildings, public funding, or a recognized Honours degree into one of Ontario’s premier universities. Moreover, he was both friend and mentor to thousands of students. Neville played a full part in provincial and national academic associations and was the first non-American to be president of the American Association of College Registrars. His two textbooks were widely used in secondary schools and he lectured publicly in the fields of education and archaeology. He was a member

of the Board of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the United Church of Canada and of the Board of Queen’s Theological College. During World War I, Neville was active in the C.O.T.C., retiring with the rank of major. In the year of his retirement, Western honored him with the D.Litt. and Queen’s with the LL.D.

Paul Nixon, known familiarly as “Nick,” translated Plautus (for the Loeb Library) and Martial into a polite and modern American idiom. His formidable wit and keen humanity, along with an understanding of human foibles, were useful qualities in his nearly 30 years as dean. In addition to his teaching and decanal duties, he served informally as a placement adviser and was instrumental in the admissions process before the establishment of a college placement bureau (1944) and admissions office (1935). Nixon was a star football player for Wesleyan and was called on regularly at Bowdoin pep rallies, never more fervently than for the Wesleyan–Bowdoin game. He was the first Rhodes Scholar from Connecticut, but did not take a degree from Oxford. After a bout with throat cancer, he died suddenly while preparing to attend the Colby football game.

Nock was one of the most distinguished classicists of the 20th century. From annual reviewer at the age of 20 for

to his work in early Christianity and Hellenistic culture, he was to earn the oft-quoted quip that “Arthur Darby Nock knows everything that there is to be known down to the year 325 
            </p>
            <p>
A.D.” 
            </p>
            <p>
He did have an incredible memory and amazing linguistic command that he combined with an unusual “speed and accuracy in reading and a delight in the discovery, ordering, and establishment of facts” (Harvard Memorial Minute, 1964). He saw himself as primarily a historian whose knowledge of primary sources enabled him to reconstruct the life and culture of a particular time and who considered the essence of religion to be in the popular practice of piety and cult.
            </p>
            <p>
He taught seminal courses in the history of ancient religions and seminars in Greek and Roman religion with an infectious verve and enthusiasm. His knowledge was vast and encyclopedic. His love of students as well as scholarship was legendary and the admiration and respect of his colleagues genuine.

Norlin, a student of Paul Shorey at Chicago, quickly established a reputation for himself at the University of Colorado as a first-rate scholar and teacher known for the clarity of his rhetoric, his Socratic method, and his multi-faceted Aristophanic sense of humor. Seen by his colleagues as a “renaissance man,” he was an athlete (boxer, swimmer, hiker, angler, tennis player), cook, poker player, and writer of poetry, as well as a skilled translator of Greek literature and analyst of contemporary issues in education and politics. Promoted rapidly, he had to reject the offer of a chair in classics at the University of Chicago when he became permanent president of the University of Colorado, continuing in his administration to devote energy to intellectual efforts, speaking publicly, and writing essays on a wide variety of scholarly and contemporary topics

(inter alia

opposing the Ku Klux Klan and Hitler’s Nazism). His administration is remembered today as largely responsible for the growth of the physical plant even during the deep Depression and the establishment of a uniform Northern Italian architectural design for the campus known as the “Colorado style.” After retirement, Norlin devoted his time to a book describing farm life in Kansas in the 1870s–1880s, where his family homestead was attacked and burned by Indians.
            </p>
            <p>
Seen as one of the truly intellectual university presidents of his time, Norlin stood for educational quality and academic integrity and viewed the mission of the university as turning out liberally educated generalists through a broadly based humanistic curriculum. The university honored him by naming after him the library he worked so hard to expand and by featuring over its doorway the quotation from his favorite author, Isocrates, “Who Knows Only his Own Generation Remains Always a Child.” He is best known on the campus today as the author of the “Charge to the Graduates,” read at every University of Colorado commencement.

Not one of his students ever became a great classical scholar, although one, Elihu Root (1845–1937), became a national figure in Republican politics. He never taught at what are optimistically called “the great universities.” And worst of all he never became president of the APA. Why is he remembered?
            </p>
            <p>
His son, upon the urging of hundreds of former students, wrote a 400–page memoir of his father. That means we have a well-documented case study of a devoted and talented teacher of Greek at a small, provincial men’s liberal arts college, Hamilton, in the hamlet of Clinton, NY, for almost 60 years. He was of the generation before Gildersleeve and 
            </p>

(Memoir, 
            </p>

215) his training antedated the German professionalism that after 1853 decisively colored American classical scholarship. One need only contrast his student and follower in what became the North Professorship, Edward Fitch, who went to Göttingen and wrote his dissertation under Wilamowitz.
            </p>
            <p>
He loved Greek, knew it well, and taught it in a way that appealed to young men who would become farmers or businessmen. “His career is a typical, although not a unique, instance of the advantages which spring from this personal and intimate contact of professor and student and the influence of this association upon the character and career of the graduate body” 
            </p>

(Memoir,

vii). He visited Greece and met and corresponded with Heinrich Schliemann. He believed the classical writers in the way men did before

            <p>
Wissenschaft

            <p>
destroyed that belief. The linguistic subtlety and literary empathy that he reveals in his published lectures and notes surpass those of most later historicists. North’s case reveals better than any other what we lost because of the German influence. Gildersleeve contrarily reveals what we gained. Both men reveal different facets of the development of an American approach to classical antiquity.

Norwood’s Cantabrigian background (imparted by Sir John Sandys and Sir Richard Jebb and, indirectly, by A. W. Verrall) and his rich humanity infused new life into Toronto’s somewhat creaky “Oxonian” system. E. T. Owen, C. N. Cochrane, and M. D. C. Tait were his spirited colleagues. Norwood had attained distinction as published scholar before his arrival at Toronto. His Canadian products—revisions of earlier works and two new major studies of Pindar and Euripides—were models of scholarship, pointing new directions in criticism, matching perceptive study of imagery with acute understanding of the ancient texts. His Sather lectures signaled a new ascendancy for classical studies at Toronto. His lectures and seminars on Pindar, Euripides, and Terence were occasions for vibrant wit and uproarious laughter, for scholarly gibes and deep emotion, for erudition on parade and inspired teaching.

James A. Notopoulos is best known for his studies of Plato’s influence on Shelley and of Homer as an oral poet. His interest in Plato and his influence culminates in 
            </p>
            <p>
The Platonism of Shelley, 
            </p>
            <p>
which was hailed by reviewers as a work of unusual scope and depth. Notopoulos went on to write essays on classical influences on Byron, Keats, Emerson, Yeats, T. E. Lawrence, and Kazantzakis.
            </p>
            <p>
A second major interest was in Greek epigraphy, to which he had been introduced by two masters, Tod of Oxford and Ferguson of Harvard. Continuing the work of Ferguson, who had discovered that the twelve Athenian tribes had provided secretaries for the government of Athens in regular and predictable cycles down to the time of Sulla in the first century B.C.E., Notopoulos showed that this “law” continued into the third century B.C.E. He thus provided the framework for redating many official inscriptions and for establishing the chronology of Athens under the Roman Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
Notopoulos’ third major interest was in continuing the work of Mil–man Parry and Albert Lord in viewing Homer as an oral poet. In 1952–3, while holding a Guggenheim Fellowship and while serving as visiting professor at the ASCSA, Notopoulos went to the hinterlands of Greece and Crete, as Parry and Lord had previously gone to Yugoslavia. On long field trips to the mountainous villages there, he recorded the oral epics and ballads still being sung and improvised by poets and traveling minstrels, some of which went back to the Middle Ages but some of which dealt with the Greek War of Independence in the 19th century and even the Nazi invasion of Crete during the World War II. The result of this study was the recording of more than 1,500 folk songs and ballads on tape, which were copied and deposited in the Library of Congress and excerpts of which were embodied in the C. N. Jackson Lectures delivered at Harvard in 1962 and published in a lengthy article, “Studies in Early Greek Oral Poetry.” Notopoulos’ original recordings and slides, as well as his unfinished book on oral literature in Greece, were given to Harvard after his death and are stored there in the Milman Parry Collection of Oral Literature.

Nutting was perhaps the last major writer on Latin grammar of our time. In addition to his many articles and numerous notes on grammatical usage, he wrote a number of teaching texts, yet was a boring and repetitive teacher, especially in his elementary classes. His student Joseph Fontenrose gives an account: “The Latin text was never read; there was no discussion of a play or poem or essay nor of the author’s literary art. The routine was invariable: Nutting called on a student to translate; the student translated a few lines or sentences, and then at a convenient stop Nutting would say, ‘Sufficient for the translation,’ make any necessary corrections, and occasionally point out some syntactical feature. Then he called on the next person to translate, and the cycle was repeated, and so on through the hour.” He also wrote short Latin plays modeled on Plautus, which he would assign his students as an introduction to the author, before reading his edition of the

Trinummus. 
            </p>
            <p>
He worked hard in the losing battle to keep Latin in California high schools and, though not warm, was kindly, helpful, calm, and proper.
